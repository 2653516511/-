# watcher问题

-Vue performs DOM updates asynchronously.

-Whenever a data change is observed, it will open a queue and buffer all the data changes that happen in the same event loop. 

-If the same watcher is triggered multiple times, it will be pushed into the queue only once.

-In the next event loop 'tick', Vue flushes the queue and performs the actual (already de-duped) work.

-For the asynchronous queuing, Internally Vue tries native Promise.then, MutationObserver, and setImmediate, falls back to setTimeout(fn, 0)

-Although Vue.js encourages the developer to think in a 'data-driven' fashion and avoid touching the DOM directly, sometimes it might be necessary to get your hands dirty. In order to wait until Vue.js has finished updating the DOM after a data change, we can use "Vue.nextTick(callback)" immediately after the data is changed. The callback will be called after the DOM has been updated. ———$nextTick() returns a promise, we can achieve the same result using the new ES2017 async/await syntax:

```jsx
data() {
	return {
		message: 'not updated'
	}
}
methods: {
	updateMessage: async function () {
		this.message = 'updated'
		console.log('before:', this.textContent)    // => 'not updated'
		await this.$nextTick()
		console.log('after:', this.textContent)     // => 'updated'
	}
}
```
